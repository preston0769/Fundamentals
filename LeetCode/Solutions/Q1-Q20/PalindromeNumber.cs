        //Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.Do this without extra space.

        //Some hints:
        //Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

        //If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

        //You could also try reversing an integer.However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow.How would you handle such case?


        //There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
